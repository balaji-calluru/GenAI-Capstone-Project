Hi Y'all

Thanks for those who attended the call today. I shared my project plan during the call. It was well received. We want to start working on the project immediately.

Here's a summary of the meeting:

I created a detailed project plan of the capstone project - "Smart Document QnA System"

The presentation is here: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/4383d1a0-9d93-4c8f-b783-9ac87a9f5843

The project is broken down into 3 sections.
Section 1 - Implements the complete base functionality of the project, tech stack, database design, project timeline, etc.
Section 2 - Extend the function to support multiple collection or category of documents
Section 3 - Extend the function to implement Multi-Agent AI architecture

My plan for the capstone project is to complete Sections 1 and 2 only.

I added Section 3 as an option for future enhancements, to continue to learn GenAI. If anyone's interested we can continue to collaborate once we complete the capstone project.

Action Items.
1) DONE - Start a GitHub repo, move the documents into the repo and share it with the team - https://github.com/balaji-calluru/GenAI-Capstone-Project
